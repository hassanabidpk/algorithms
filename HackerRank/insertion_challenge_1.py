Given a sorted list with an unsorted number V in the rightmost cell, can 
you write some simple code to insert V into the array so that it remains sorted?

Print the array every time a value is shifted in the array until the array is fully sorted. 
The goal of this challenge is to follow the correct order of insertion sort.
